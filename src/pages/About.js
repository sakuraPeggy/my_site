          Hello, I'm a passionate web developer with a love for creating intuitive and interactive websites. With experience in technologies like React, JavaScript, and Material UI, I aim to build seamless and efficient web experiences.
          <br />
          <br />
          My journey in web development began with a simple curiosity about how websites are built. Since then, Iâ€™ve grown my skills in both front-end and back-end development. I enjoy learning new technologies and challenges that help me grow as a developer.
